# Advent of Code 2024

A small exercise to solve abstract problems and become more familiar with Kotlin.

My goal is to solve all days with the first methods that come to mind.
I disabled all AI support for this repo, so not to forget how to code without it ;)

Feel free to try sloving the problems yourself, Advent of Code is a perfect oppertinuty to sharpen your programming skills and try new languages
